# Ecommerce-data-warehouse
An end-to-end automated Ecommerce Data Warehouse, encompassing data processing from raw sources to staging, and ultimately to the warehouse, with the implementation of Slowly Changing Dimensions, all powered by a stack that includes PostgreSQL, NoSQL databases, and Python.

This repository contains an end-to-end Ecommerce Data Warehouse solution that automates the process of ingesting, processing, and storing data from raw sources to a fully structured data warehouse. The solution is designed to handle data transformations, implement Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD), and provide a foundation for business intelligence and analysis. The primary technologies used in this project include PostgreSQL, NoSQL databases, and Python scripts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components, each responsible for a specific stage in the data processing pipeline:

### 1. Staging Tables

- Staging tables are the first point of entry for raw data.
- Staging tables are created to temporarily store raw data before it undergoes transformation and moves to the data warehouse.
- Raw data is ingested into these staging tables using Python scripts.

### 2. Data Transformation

- Data transformation processes are applied to the data stored in the staging tables.
- These transformations include data cleaning, validation, and formatting.
- The goal is to prepare the data for insertion into the data warehouse and ensure data quality.

### 3. Dimension Tables and Fact Tables

- Dimension tables and fact tables are created in the data warehouse.
- Dimension tables store reference data, providing context for the facts.
- Fact tables store the core transactional data.
- Data from the staging tables is ingested into the appropriate dimension and fact tables.

### 4. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

- Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) are implemented to handle changes in dimension data over time.
- Four types of SCD (0, 1, 2, 3) are implemented, allowing for different strategies to manage historical data.

### 5. Business Intelligence Integration

- A Business Intelligence (BI) tool is integrated with the data warehouse.
- The BI tool enables data analysts and stakeholders to perform data analysis, generate reports, and gain insights from the structured data.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-data-warehouse.git
cd ecommerce-data-warehouse
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies and libraries for Python scripts, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases.

### 3. Database Configuration

- Set up your PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases as per your project requirements.
- Update the database connection configurations in the Python scripts used for data ingestion and transformation.

### 4. Cron Job Setup

- Schedule the Python scripts for data ingestion as cron jobs to regularly fetch and load new raw data into the staging tables.

### 5. Data Transformation

- Define data transformation logic in Python scripts as needed.
- Test and validate the data transformation processes.

### 6. SCD Implementation

- Implement Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) logic in the database or Python scripts to handle historical data changes.

### 7. Business Intelligence Tool Integration

- Connect your Business Intelligence (BI) tool to the data warehouse.
- Create dashboards and reports for data analysis.

## Usage

### Data Ingestion:

- Raw data is ingested automatically via scheduled Python scripts.
- Data ingestion scripts fetch data from external sources and load it into the staging tables.

### Data Transformation:

- Data transformation scripts process the data in the staging tables.
- Transformations may include cleaning, validation, and formatting.

### SCD Handling:

- Slowly Changing Dimensions are managed automatically within the data warehouse.

### Business Intelligence:

- Use your BI tool to analyze data, create reports, and gain insights.
